        question: "Which coding platform to choose in the beginning?",
        opinion: "As a first-year student, gaining confidence in coding is crucial, and solving coding problems is a key way to achieve that. This can improve your interest in coding and benefit your career. Choosing the right coding platform plays a major role in building that confidence. Among popular platforms like LeetCode, CodeChef, and HackerRank, I recommend starting with HackerRank.\n\nThe reason is that HackerRank offers a range of beginner-friendly problems that focus on basic concepts, which can help build your confidence. In contrast, platforms like LeetCode might present more challenging problems, especially with base cases, which can be difficult for beginners and may lead to frustration.\n\nStarting with HackerRank, particularly in C programming, can be a great way to build your skills gradually and gain the confidence you need to tackle more complex problems later on.",
